**Total: 127 metrics**

**Legend:**
- TBD = To Be Determined (requires further research)
- ~Year = Approximate year (concept existed around this time)

**Notes:**
- Many classical statistical metrics (MSE, MAE, correlation coefficients) have origins in statistics dating back to the 1800s-1900s
- Modern ML adaptations of these metrics may have different formalization dates
- Some metrics marked "TBD" are very recent (2020s) but lack precise publication dates without deeper research
